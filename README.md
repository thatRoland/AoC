# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the problems of [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Currently, they are written in Python 3, although it's possible I will add new solutions in other languages as I learn them. You can run the programs with `python3 day##.py`. The complete data and the example data of a problem are to be named `data.txt` and `test.txt`, respectively, and should be in the same folder as the script. I'm planning to add that you can specify the input file as an argument in the command line.

Keep in mind that there's room for improvement and optimization, which I plan to do. Scripts committed here worked on the test input and my actual input, too.
